# Handoff Notes / Micro Learnings
- UI can mangle long heredocs → prefer short, ordered paste blocks.
- Always return a structured JSON verdict ().
- Repo slug for gh should be like `cvanbogaert/ua-emergence` (no `.git`).
- If remote blocks workflow pushes over HTTPS, use PAT with `workflow,repo` or use SSH.
- Feature branch alignment: safest path was reset onto `origin/main` then restore minimal scaffold.
- Labels `plan-only`, `tier:B` are accepted triggers; Draft PR preferred.
- Keep plan-only **non-mutating**; artifacts: plan.json, plan.log, changes.patch, comment.md.
- Preference recorded: recursive intent tree → atomic actions; continuous success/retry/fail evaluation.

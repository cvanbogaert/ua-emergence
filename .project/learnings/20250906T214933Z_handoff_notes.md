# Handoff Notes / Micro Learnings — 2025-09-06T21:49:33Z
- UI can mangle long heredocs → prefer short, ordered paste blocks.
- Always return a structured JSON verdict (`intent_verification`).
- Repo slug for `gh` should be `cvanbogaert/ua-emergence` (no `.git`).
- For workflow pushes over HTTPS, use a PAT with scopes: `workflow,repo`.
- Branch alignment: reset feature to `origin/main`, then restore minimal scaffold.
- Labels `plan-only`, `tier:B` trigger plan-only workflow; Draft PR preferred.
- Plan-only must be **non-mutating**; artifacts: `plan.json`, `plan.log`, `changes.patch`, `comment.md`.
- Working style: recursive intent tree → atomic actions; continuous success/retry/fail evaluation.
- Keep scripts cwd-agnostic; avoid env/venv assumptions; survive VM restarts.

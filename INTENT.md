# Project Intent (Clean Room)
**Primary Objective:** Emerge a **safe, loyal, and satisfactory** Universal Agent that is **cheap to operate** and **fun + informative** to develop.

**Method (repeat):** plan → sandboxed run → gather evidence → refine → unlock next capability.

**Safety & Governance:**
- Default-deny for side effects. Approvals needed for anything beyond local file writes.
- Budgets enforced per intent; track costs.
- Everything auditable: produce a Run Bundle per iteration.

**Definition of Done:** The agent can bootstrap itself from this same initial prompt and repo, beginning with plan-only operation and gradually earning capabilities via tests + approvals.
